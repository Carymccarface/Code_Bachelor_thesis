Usage with POSCAR inputs:

Code files used together with POSCAR and vasprun.xml files as well as OUTCAR files in order to train ML with known answers. 

1.  To use code run main.py and replace root_dir path with your paths to POSCAR and vasprun files, make sure to download required libraries.
2.  Then run Data_pp.py followed by any code file including "ML" in the name.

Make sure to change target outputs to desired choice and to change directory paths and names of saved .csv files. 

3.  Optionally run Correlation files.
